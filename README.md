# Predator Vs Prey

## Explanation
The classic Predator vs Prey simulation where the creatures are 
controlled by biologically inspired evolving neural networks.
Naturally, networks evolve in generations where the parent is
selected due to good performance. This is all raw python apart
from pygame for rendering and numpy for matrix operations.

# Todo List
* Tweak how energy works in prey
* Tweak the best performance system
* Tweak neural network; take in energy as an input
* Heavily optimize the sensor system
